##To-Do-App

1. Install Node.js
   
    ✔️ Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from nodejs.org.
      
2. Create a New Project with Vite
   
    ✔️ Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create the project. Then run the following command to create a new project using Vite:

       ✅ npm create vite@latest

   ✅ You'll be prompted to name your project and select the framework. For a React project, choose "React".
        
4. Install the Dependencies
   
    ✔️ Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

       ✅ cd project-name

    ✔️ Then, install the necessary dependencies:

       ✅ npm install
        
6. Start the Development Server
   
   ✔️ To start the server and view your application in the browser, run:

       ✅ npm run dev
        
7. Build for Production
   
   ✔️ If you want to compile the application for production, run the following command:
   
       ✅ npm run build

This will generate optimized static files in the dist folder, ready to be deployed.
